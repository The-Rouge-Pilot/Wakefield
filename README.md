This game is made to run on the Minetest Engine, made by celron55.

Wakefield is open source, free, and  moddable. It features a "Zombie Apocalypse" type gameplay. Anyone who wishes to modify it may do so (but a little credit would be nice).
I give a BIG thanks to all the modders whose useful mods I used.
